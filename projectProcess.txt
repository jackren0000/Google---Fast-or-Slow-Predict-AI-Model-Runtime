Q&A:
1. what is XLA?
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with 
potentially no source code changes. For instance, "tf.reduce_sum(x + y * z)", XLA fuse the multiplication, addition and reduction
into a signle kernel instead of three.
