Project Description:
AI model can be represented as a graph, where a node is a tensor operation (i.e. matrix multiplication, convolution, ect),
and an edge represents a tensor.

A compilation configuration controls how the compiler transforms the graph for a specific optimization pass.
There are two types of configuration/optimizations:

1. A layout configuration: control how tensors in the graph are laid out in the physical memory, by specifying the dimension order 
of each input and output of an operation node.

2

About the dataset:
TpuGraphs is the performance prediction dataset on XLA HLO graphs running on TPU (Tensor Processing Units) V3.

There are 5 data collections in total:
1. layout:xla:random
2. layout:xla:default
3. layout:nlp:random
4. layout:nlp:default
5. title: xla

*********Notice******* 
The final score is the average across all collections.

Q&A:
1. what is XLA?
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow models with 
potentially no source code changes. For instance, "tf.reduce_sum(x + y * z)", XLA fuse the multiplication, addition and reduction
into a signle kernel instead of three.
